excerpt: 'The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) uses statewide, redundant, physically separate, fiber and microwave communications networks for mission critical services. However, there are two specific geographical regions that do not support redundant, physically separate networks. These two regions are the Florida panhandle and the Florida Keys. It may be possible to remove this vulnerability and implement a redundant communication path by utilizing a beyond Line-of-Sight(b-LoS) microwave link. A b-LoS microwave link uses the atmospheric evaporative duct which can be present immediately above large bodies of water. A propagation study project is underway that will investigate using this evaporative duct to create a 500-mile microwave link, across the Gulf of Mexico, between Key West and Destin, Florida. Such a link could potentially create an opportunity to introduce redundancy for both vulnerable geographic regions at the same time. This study will require the remote operation of two temporary microwave propagation test stations over an extended period. The separate transmit and receive test stations will use two candidate microwave frequencies for one-way link tests between the two locations. At the end of the propagation study, the results will be published and recommendations on next steps will be presented to the FDOT.'
