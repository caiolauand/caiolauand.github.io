excerpt: 'There are only a few ways that a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
can communicate with Earth without a ground station network.
A LEO satellite can link with other LEO satellites establishing a
mesh network that connects with Earth, or LEO satellites can
relay their traffic through one of only a few specialized existing
or planned geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) or medium Earth orbit
(MEO) relay satellites such as the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and Audacy. Unfortunately, there is a real
possibility that these limited choices for satellite communications will not accommodate all of the anticipated growth in LEO
satellite deployments that are forecast for the next 10 years. The
less efficient direct LEO to Earth communications link method
will be used unless another solution can be found. A new option
may be to leverage the on-orbit commercial GEO satellites that
already support the fixed satellite services (FSSs) market. In this
scenario, a LEO satellite would relay its communications through
the GEO satellite and down to an Earth station, much the same
way terrestrial very small aperture terminals, cruise ships, or jet
airliners do today. Utilizing several of these commercial GEO
satellites, a LEO satellite could communicate with Earth during a
large portion of each orbit. There are some challenges with such
a scheme, including regulatory hurdles, but if they could be
overcome a significant resource of satellite communication
services could be engaged to support the future growth of the
satellite industry. Several new LEO to GEO relay methods have
been proposed or are in development, requiring the deployment
of new GEO relay satellites, but this article discusses the idea of
utilizing the hundreds of existing FSS GEO satellites operating in
C, Ku, and Ka band to leverage an existing resource for satellite
communications with LEO satellites.'
