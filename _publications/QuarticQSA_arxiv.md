Stochastic approximation is a foundation for many algorithms found in machine learning and optimization. It is in general slow to converge:  the mean square error vanishes as $$O(n^{-1})$$. A deterministic counterpart known as quasi-stochastic approximation is a viable alternative in many applications, including gradient-free optimization and reinforcement learning.   It was assumed in prior research that the optimal achievable convergence rate is $$O(n^{-2})$$. It is shown in this paper that through design it is possible to obtain far faster convergence, of order $$O(n^{-4+\delta})$$, with $$\delta>0$$ arbitrary.   
Two techniques are introduced for the first time to achieve this rate of convergence.   The theory is also specialized within the context of gradient-free optimization, and tested on standard benchmarks.  The main results are based on a combination of novel application of results from number theory and techniques adapted from stochastic approximation theory.
